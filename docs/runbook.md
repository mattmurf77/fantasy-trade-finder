# Runbook

Operational procedures. Add to this as you learn things.

---

## Local dev

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python run.py            # Flask on :5000
```

Mobile:
```bash
cd mobile && npm install && npx expo start --tunnel
```

Extension: `chrome://extensions` → developer mode → Load unpacked → pick `extension/`.

Port conflicts: macOS AirPlay Receiver uses :5000. Free it: `lsof -ti:5000 | xargs kill -9`.

## Deploy (Render)

`render.yaml` drives the deploy. Push to GitHub `main` and Render auto-builds.

- **Backend:** Python service runs `run.py`.
- **DB:** Postgres via injected `DATABASE_URL`.
- **Static:** `web/` served by Flask.
- Set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in Render dashboard if smart matchups should be enabled in prod.

---

## Database

- **Local:** SQLite at `data/trade_finder.db`. Back up by copying the file.
- **Prod:** Postgres via `DATABASE_URL`. Take a Render snapshot before destructive changes.
- **Schema source of truth:** `backend/database.py`.
- **Migrations:** No migration tool. `_migrate_db()` in `database.py` applies idempotent additive ALTERs and seeds `model_config` defaults via INSERT OR IGNORE on every startup. For destructive changes, write a one-off script and run it manually.

---

## Feature flags

- Edit `config/features.json` and commit/deploy, OR
- `POST /api/feature-flags/reload` to re-read without restart, OR
- Set `FTF_FLAGS` env var for process-level overrides.

---

## Runtime tuning

`model_config` table is editable live:
```
GET /api/admin/config           # read all
PUT /api/admin/config/<key>     # update one
```
See [config-reference.md](config-reference.md) for keys.

---

## Debug log

In-memory ring buffer (last ~200 entries):
```
GET /api/debug/log?n=100
```

---

## Common failure modes

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Smart matchup returns boring pairs | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` not set, or `smart_matchup_enabled=0` | Set the env var; flip the config |
| Tier colors disagree across clients | Drift in tier color tokens | See [cross-client-invariants](cross-client-invariants.md) |
| Trade Finder still locked after many ranks | Per-position threshold not met (10 each) | Rank more of the missing position |
| Mobile can't reach backend | Not on tunnel; backend on different network | Run Expo with `--tunnel` |
| Push notifications not arriving | No `device_tokens` row, or pref bucket off, or quiet hours active | Check `notification_prefs`, `device_tokens`, and `notification_queue` for the user |
| Queued pushes never deliver | Cron ticks not firing | Verify Render cron schedule hits `/api/cron/*-tick` |
| Duplicate pushes for same event | `dedup_key` not set or differs across calls | Ensure `_send_typed_push` is given a stable `dedup_key` |

---

## Cron schedule

External scheduler (Render cron) must hit:

| Endpoint | Recommended cadence |
|---|---|
| `POST /api/cron/realtime-tick` | every 1–5 min |
| `POST /api/cron/hourly-tick` | hourly (top of hour) |
| `POST /api/cron/daily-tick` | once daily |

If these stop firing, queued pushes pile up in `notification_queue` and digests/re-engagement go silent.

## Reset / wipe

```
POST /api/reset
```
Wipes the current user's `swipe_decisions`, `trade_decisions`, `member_rankings`.
